this is a BPSK31 RF mode decoder, this is a github pages site that can decode BPSK31 audio
no other modes and encoding will be added, making the script to decode the BPSK31 took me almost forever, and I really don't want to go through that again
there are some problems with the decoder, but if the decoding isn't right, then download a program like Fldigi and decode it like that
